## Important Note About Story Access ‚ö†Ô∏è

Due to Telegram API restrictions, this script can only access stories from:

This is a limitation of Telegram's API and cannot be bypassed.

- Downloads both photos and videos from stories
- Stores metadata in SQLite database
- Exports data to Excel spreadsheet
- Real-time monitoring with customizable intervals
- Timestamp is set to (UTC+2)
- Maintains record of previously downloaded stories
- Resume capability
- Automatic retry mechanism

## Prerequisites üìã

Before running the script, you'll need:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Telegram account
- API credentials from Telegram
- Friends on Telegram whose stories you want to track

### Required Python packages
